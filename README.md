# Divergences
This program is about an interactive story telling that relates the life of a student that starts in a new high school.
The game was developed in Android Studio and programated in Kotlin with a SQLite database to auto-save the progress you make in it. You can load your game that will be saved in the app or create a new game deleting the older game saved.

It's just a demo, but i hope you enjoy it! 

Here you have some screenshots so you can take a look at it:
